# ACO
(for my CS154 course project)
#
Implemented in Racket, run main.rkt.
#
Ant Colony Optimization and brute force method implementations for TSP and graphical simulation of algorithm working with heat map. ACO is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial Ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is the predominant paradigm used.
